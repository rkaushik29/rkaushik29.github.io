<h2 id="problem-descriptor">problem descriptor</h2>
<p>Growing demand for jobs in companies that are growing, paired with a limited supply, leads to increasingly standardized testing processes in recruiting that are long, repetitive and generate no value.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">the problem</h2>
<p>With agencies like Randstad and LinkedIn connecting people to enterprises without extensively verifying their expertise and experience, the hiring processes are gradually inching towards verifing skills of candidates in an extremely standardized fashion. This problem exists in any industry that demands its employees to take an objective (especially determinate) test in the selection process to obtain proof of the candiate’s knowledge and problem-solving skills. This leads to time-consuming and repetitive hiring processes with a high probability of zero value generation on either side, since most candidates are rejected. The nature of humanity exacerbates this; when presented with a usually hard standardized test, people invest large amounts of time learning to beat it rather than learning from a larger pool of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">the solution</h2>
<p>The utility of NFTs are widespread; they can conceptually be used to provide proof of
knowledge and/or expertise. I plan to create a web3 app that generates non-tradeable NFTs for any digitally verifiable
task that is successfully completed; these would represent the individual&rsquo;s skill and knowledge in
completing that task. A collection of these NFTs can be an individual&rsquo;s digital portfolio that can be
dynamically generated as they create. Unlike conventional portfolios, the claims here will be verifiable.
Consequently, enterprises across many industries will no longer require standardized testing since the
NFTs of a candidate are the proof of their knowledge and skill. This eliminates the need for initial skill
verification testing, shortens hiring processes considerably, and provides employers much more data
about claims on an NFT portfolio. People will no longer have to worry about investing large amounts of
time to prepare for a multitude of hiring tests. If NFT collections unique to companies are distributed among its employees,
all of an employee&rsquo;s work under that company can be encoded under this one, and the NFT&rsquo;s defintion can be extended to an
employment contract, with attached benefits like health insurance, visa sponsorships, taxation records, etc.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-market">proof of market</h2>
<p>Over the summer, I reached out to fifty startup founders and CEOs
across the world, from the Y-Combinator batches of S22 and S21, asking them if they found utility in a
product that would give them proof of their employee candidates&rsquo; expertise/skill. Thirty-four of them were
open to trying out the application. Ten of them wanted a demo and/or were keen on using the product
right away. The eagerness of these companies from surveys is the only tangible evidence I have that it can
be monetized in several ways (eg: a premium for more data about candidates&rsquo; experience). I have also asked a plethora of students at UWaterloo and
prospective and present employees about using this, and not one person has said that they would not use it!</p>
