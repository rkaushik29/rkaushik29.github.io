<h2 id="problem-descriptor">problem descriptor</h2>
<p>Growing demand for jobs in companies that are growing, paired with a limited supply, leads to increasingly standardized testing processes in recruiting that are long, repetitive, generate no value, and consequently allow fabricated experience to be considered.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">the problem</h2>
<p>With agencies like Randstad and LinkedIn connecting people to enterprises without extensively verifying their expertise and experience, the hiring processes are gradually inching towards verifing skills of candidates in an extremely standardized fashion. This problem exists in any industry that demands its employees to take an objective (especially determinate) test in the selection process to obtain proof of the candiate’s knowledge and problem-solving skills. This leads to time-consuming and repetitive hiring processes with a high probability of zero value generation on either side, since most candidates are rejected. The nature of humanity exacerbates this; when presented with a usually hard standardized test, people invest large amounts of time learning to beat it rather than learning from a larger pool of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">the solution</h2>
<p>The utility of tokens are widespread; they can conceptually be used to provide proof of
knowledge and/or expertise. I plan to create a protocol that generates verified credentials for any digitally verifiable
task that is successfully completed; these would represent the individual&rsquo;s skill and knowledge in
completing that task. A collection of these tokens can be an individual&rsquo;s digital portfolio that can be
dynamically generated as they create. Unlike conventional portfolios, the claims here will be verifiable.
Consequently, enterprises across many industries will no longer require standardized testing since the
tokens of a candidate are the proof of their knowledge and skill. This eliminates the need for initial skill
verification testing, shortens hiring processes considerably, and provides employers much more data
about claims on a portfolio. People will no longer have to worry about investing large amounts of
time to prepare for a multitude of hiring tests. If token collections unique to companies are distributed among its employees,
all of an employee&rsquo;s work under that company can be encoded under this, and the token&rsquo;s defintion can be extended to an
employment contract, with attached benefits like health insurance, visa sponsorships, taxation records, etc.</p>
<h2 id="education">education</h2>
<p>It is a fact that throughout all of university, we do several courses and the schooling system forces us to specialize in one particular field, while allowing us to choose other subjects of interest (and enforcing us to necessarily do some extra courses as part of depth and breadth requirements). At the end, we get a piece of paper (a.k.a college degree) that proves that we have successfully made it through this educational system with sufficient knowledge. What offers credibility to these degrees is the fact that they are given out by reputed institutions in the world. So, essentially, a degree from a lesser known university is not worth the same as the same degree from a “good” school. I had an idea: why can’t students be given these credentials for all the learning and work that students do for their higher education?I think this would add several dimensions to a college degree; these tokens can be minted for each course or each assignment that students successfully complete, and can contain data about how they performed (even relative to each other). A final college degree can be (while not yet replaced) given out together with a collection of tokens that prove and represent the exact pool of knowledge one has taken away from school. Moreover, it is a fact that many many students in the world are not able to attend university due to financial situations, and a lot of educational platforms like khan academy, coursera and udemy have courses about basically anything on their platforms. I am highly considering looking into partnerships with these platforms for the same arrangement, give out provable tokens representing proof of knowledge itself. I think this would encourage people to use these platforms more, since they can complete <code>x</code> courses with a distibution of <code>a, b, c</code> subjects and get a self-serve online degree where can choose what things to specialize in and how much in depth to study any of them. This also allows people to combine subjects as they please. And the resultant “degree” they get is certainly irrefutable in terms of how reliability and validity by the very definition of tokens and the nature of blockchain technology.</p>
