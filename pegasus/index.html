<p>Helping Unicorns Fly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To begin with a little background about me: I grew up in Bangalore, India (the silicon valley of India, and rightly so in my opinion). I have always been senisitive to and influenced by the communities around me. Main reason → I grew up going to just one school from age 2-17. I went through the foundational years of my life growing up with the same cohort of about 80 kids, and I am truly grateful for this experience because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was able to observe how this community grew and matured as humans, and how factors like social media and technology influenced their thoughs and personalities.</li>
<li>They were really smart kids who now go to the best schools like Oxford, UCB, LSE etc., so I have a network of great friends around the world, who are practicing very different things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The number of startups around me were plenty, and I witnessed acquaintances with small businesses grow those businesses into national and international enterprises, some even becoming unicorns (eg: InMobi). In addition to this, the youth participated heavily in hackathons and that piqued my interest in development, because I could see tangible impact almost instantly after writing a few lines of code → conglomerating CS and ideas are the most powerful things to happen to our civilization.</p>
<p>I took all this inspiration from around me, and my champions like Mark and Elon, and I build my own start-up when I was 15, called Rent-A-Game. Initially, we were a FB page that would post news and related information about things happening in the gaming world, like a new game or console. Once we accrued a following of &gt;1000 people, and a community evolved that interacted with us, by observation, I noticed a bigger problem: many people who wanted to play games could not due to high CD prices, and not enough ROI since gameplay is ~20 hrs. Online gaming was not in its prime back then either. I reached out to the community and asked game owners who finished games to lend them out to others, and they got royalties from what we charged the renters. I created an online interface for this, but the ROI of time was not worth it ($50 per week).</p>
<p>Pivoted to an entertainment label which we centered around the community, to empower them and for them to empower us. People would stream for us 24/7 on Twitch, and they would get paid based on the viewership we had. We let them run our Facebook page, and we organized nationwide gaming tournaments which saw several hundred people show up. Eventually began making $2000 per month; most satisfying experience of my life.</p>
<p>That’s who I am, I enjoy observing communities of people, and building solutions that are empowered by these communities, because of a couple philosophical beliefs of mine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Love &amp; Passion: This is very foundational and inuitive. If someone is in love with or passionate about something, their brain will get into a state of flow (or as the Japanse call it, Ikigai) when they are working on it.</li>
<li>Limbic Resonance: this has been written about for nearly a century, and me having worked with communities/interest groups, and having lived in 4 countries, I have personally observed this around me. It is also written about in “a general theory of love” by Thomas Lewis.
It is defined as: our brain chemistry and nervous systems are measurably affected by those closest to us. Intuitively, the brain is more invested in connecting with other brains when there is a common interest. This leads to a interconnection of minds in an interest group which allows them to collectively come up with new &amp; creative thought processes that an individual mind could either take time to come up with, or not do so at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I’m truly glad that Meta is taking steps to promote this by allowing creative collaboration through their metaverse. This is going to be artistically and creatively very liberating for humanity.</p>
<p>I truly believe that this collaborative ecosystem needs to exist globally for communities to build anything together. Elon Musk said, in an interview with Lex Fridman, that his advice to young people would be → &ldquo;be useful, it is hard to really be useful.&rdquo; As much as I admire Elon Musk, who I grew up looking up to, what he said really hit a nerve for me. It should not be hard to be useful. And I observed this while spending time at University. Most people around me, who came into school as lively intellectual humans gradually lost their imagination because they spent endless hours working towards getting a job. This is a big issue since, at a time where a group of people come together to practice what they all love collaboratively and symbiotically, they do everything but that (for the most part). The employment system is the issue.</p>
<p>Now here’s how this model is implemented today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest groups come together to form a project, or a company, as it increases in value, more people want to contribute to it, even if they don’t believe have heartfelt belief in it, due to the promise of money, and lack of other specific opportunities they care about.</li>
<li>As more people want in, seats become limited and valuable in these projects, and hiring standards increase. A problem here is: hiring is becoming standardized, so this shifts the focus of people from working for creative outcomes to working long and hard to memorize testing processes/questions in order to get into a company.</li>
<li>People get paid by the hour, and this de-incentivizes people from working to produce value, they take overtime to finish work they can actually do in 4 hours to get more money, which is a fair response of humanity&rsquo;s selfish nature to this current system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how I think it should work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of setting these high barriers to entry, people should be freely allowed to contribute to any and many projects → open source. The value they produce in a project will directly translate into the share they own in the project.</li>
<li>People should be hired based on proof of actual work they do and value they produce. this incentivizes people to work hard towards improving web communities and the whole internet ecosystem, rather than memorizing testing processes to game the system → added benefit of not letting impostors who luckily beat the testing system and get in (removes associated offboarding &amp; termination costs)</li>
<li>Project A should be allowed to contribute to another project B, and this should result in a fractional ownership of A in B ⇒ if B increases in value so does A and vice versa. this leads to growth of the entire ecosystem, and incentizes B to help out A for the same reason.</li>
<li>People should get paid based on the collective value that their contributions produce. If I create $10 value in A and using this, A gives $100 value to B, then I should earn a fractional value of $10 + $100 that my work produced in B. More incentive for people to produce value rather than working longer and harder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what I want to do:</p>
<p>I want to liberate us from this current system, which is becoming a hyperobject for our civilization, by building an ecosystem for the numerous communities in the world and prove on a market driven by community, web3, that the strategy works. The pegasus protocol will allow any project to run on the chain, as an open source project that anyone can contribute to, and their work will be rewarded with project tokens to represent their knowledge, skill and experience of working in the things they love doing. These tokens can be used to determine if an individual has the pre-requisite skills to work in other projects, so people are allowed to work for everyone on the chain. Projects can help other projects. Anyone can create anything as long as a community exists that can contribute to it somehow. All projects on the chain help each other grow and the market grows faster. The tokens will also represent shares of contributors in projects. They will serve as an employment contract themselves (by proof of knwoledge, skill and expertise) which can be used to provide other employee benefits reliant on a contract, like insurance, gym memberships, visas, etc. Investors can directly observe how a project is growing (by activity) and use this as a metric to make more informed decisions. Projects that start will be given pegasus protocol’s native tokens, used to vote for onbparding new projects to ensure that no malicious projects startup, through a voting mechanism.</p>
<p>What this would result in, is an ecosystem of limbically resonant minds (meta-minds) in each project working together to product maximum value. Each meta mind can symbiotically work with other meta-minds to help grow the other, and grow the whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>The main things that make this viable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>no barrier to entry</li>
<li>people will want to work on this because the value they create gives them money, and they can do so with n projects. Their contributions are publically visible, so they can be employed on a full-time basis because of making more of these valuable contributions.</li>
<li>can be applied to absolutely anything that &gt;1 person in the world is interested in, so there is scope to contribute on literally anything that &gt;1 is interested in, so people don’t have to settle for something they aren’t interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why me?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I think I am the only one who can make this happen.</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe that currently, I am the only one who understands the vision well enough to be able to formulate stringent and fair market tokenomics for this protocol, which is the main issue and the foundational basis of this marketplace.</li>
<li>I am interested in many things, and I am good at many things as well, but I am not as passionate about it. There are knowledgeable and experienced people in all those domains who can do more productive work than I can, solely due to their passion, so I choose not to.</li>
<li>Most other individuals I have met, are invested entirely and interested in solving particular problems that society faces. They are invested in creating tangible value through products. It would be impossible for such people who are experts in certain fields, and fixated on solving massive potentially billion dollar problems in front of them, to co-ordinate a group of these meta-minds and push them in the right direction for positive growth. That’s a whole other domain of problem. Me on the other hand, have the time and ability to, like I’ve always done, observe these meta-minds tackling billion dollar problems and help them navigate &amp; collaborate with each other in meaningful ways in the ecosystem, and solve the problems associated with this from my experiences.</li>
</ol>
