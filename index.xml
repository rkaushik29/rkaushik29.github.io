problem descriptor Growing demand for jobs in companies that are growing, paired with a limited supply, leads to increasingly standardized testing processes in recruiting that are long, repetitive, generate no value, and consequently allow fabricated experience to be considered.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Finished products are for decadent minds.&amp;rdquo; - Bail Channis, Second Foundation
Hi üëã
I&amp;rsquo;m Rohit, a fourth year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Waterloo.

I witnessed the growth of myriad small businesses1 (into large national and multi-national corporations) throughout my childhood, and thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;If they can do it, why not me?</description>
