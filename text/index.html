<h3 id="the-problem">the problem</h3>
<p>Hiring in companies is becoming more standardized with time. Employees are forced to solve hackerrank / leetcode type problems to display their technical expertise to corporations, and then go through several rounds of technical &amp; behavioural interviews to determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>the way they form a solution, given a problem</li>
<li>the way they communicate to others on their team (or otherwise)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason for the initial filter is to save the company’s time and money spent in interviewing interviewees who are not adequately skilled; companies do acquire skilled employees this way, but also end up hiring those who try hard enough to “beat the system” by paying leetcode and solving a bunch of problems/memorizing answers &amp; reading many books on cracking coding interviews (companies have further filters like: 1 yr without promotion ⇒ severance ⇒ loss of resources for onboarding &amp; offboarding employees without significant gain from the individual). This is most apparent in software, but hiring is becoming standardized in several other domains. Another problem with this is that employees spend countless hours preparing for interview tests; in software: practicing DP / tree search algos which run on some remote server somewhere and both the time &amp; energy spent in doing so does not really do anything to benefit the employee’s intellectual growth or the company.
Additonally, employees need to go through this process for all companies that they apply to, and they will spend time running meaningless code that achieves nothing for every job application.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will eventually lead to everyone trying hard to simply pass coding tests (with goal to work at FAANG) &amp; only memorize specific algos to achieve that; this is at UWaterloo. This will lead to decline in software creativity of employees &amp; innovation reduction on web2, which will eventually threaten the very existence of enterprises on current protocols.</li>
<li>The time spent by people going through programming test questions can be used to contribute to the growth of projects and communities on the internet, or the internet itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-solution">the solution</h3>
<p>Instead of focusing on methods of hiring that have a prospect of being standardized, like testing on a finite set of problems, my product aims to constantly ensure, from now until the end of time, that hiring in companies remains non-standardized.</p>
<p>The way this is achieved is through hiring using a different, but equally reliable metric: open source contributions.</p>
<p>The advantages this gives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>While working towards being hired, people will work on &amp; solve active issues on the internet, be it on web2 or web3, rather than memorizing/practicing different algorithms for many hours that have 0 net productive output, and this will speed up technological advancement of our civilization to rates we have never seen before.</li>
<li>This is reliable since a decision to interview someone will be based off of their work that has direct practical impact, and it is credible since an open source project has approved their work to be put to use, and it is revealing since the quality of contributions can be seen and adjudicated by any hiring manager easily.</li>
<li>While hiring, companies can chose to hire people based off of the pool of contributors to their own open source projects, since those people are likely to be of more use &amp; a better fit in the company (less onboarding, low chance of not being useful, etc.). Moreover, this should incentivize many companies to actually open source some of their (not-core) projects and/or generate open source projects for people to contribute to!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this leads to 3 simultaneous improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement of the candidate’s knowledge of practical problems in their industry (which school does not embellish), and ccontinually evolves their way of thinking to solve such real problems → non-standardization since problems keep changing with time.</li>
<li>Usage of candidate’s time and effort to work towards getting a job (through open source contributions) in actually improving internet organizations and communities.</li>
<li>Creation of more open source projects to benefit the web &amp; to produce some value to companies from the time invested in hiring.</li>
</ul>
<p>→ Contributions can be made in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging in PRs / integrating contributions</li>
<li>Putting up PRs / contributing to a project</li>
<li>Open Source contribution for an organization can be digital proof of any work done, uploaded to github (or submitted in any digital form to the project) to be viewed by anyone!</li>
<li>People can accept contributions as part of participation! → project owners with bottleneck of PRs (contributions) to accept can delegate this work to other people who can be trained to accept work of a certain standard &amp; people will want to do this, since it counts for open source contribution &amp; will count towards their professional career.</li>
