<p>Most of the work done at MealMe was using python, flask, mongodb, and related tools to create services and APIs</p>
<ul>
<li>Added over 200,000 grocery stores and restaurants from Canada and USA to the Search Engine service database (mongodb).</li>
<li>Streamlined the alerting process for search engine failures, exceptions and crashes by separating notification channels on slack to improve readability.</li>
<li>Created endpoints to allow cross communication between services in the company, allowing data to be seamlessly transferred from them to the search engine database, to improve data consistency and accuracy between services. Improved search accuracy by 38%, contributing to acquiring Series A.</li>
<li>Indexed the entire search engine database, to improve speed of data retrieval from user search queries → improvement from 8s down to 2s. Also indexed data retrieved from other internal services, which allowed us to crawl data faster, amounted to adding 0.7 new stores per second on average → key Series A metric.</li>
<li>Worked with API clients on an external slack channel to continually assess their needs and requests, added endpoints accordingly and fixed any issues they ran into. Helped in increasing our client base for Series A.</li>
<li>Implemented real time updating of store information. AlertBot → segregated warnings and failures for more readability and directed alerts on important issues. Improved unit tests for search to return more reliable data without using external APIs.</li>
<li>Sped up compilation time for the search algorithm for the engine, increased speed by 64%,  which means less downtime for the app when updating the service. Also sped up crawling algorithm, crawling and adding 2 stores per second to our database.</li>
<li>Made search results more relevant by using factors dependent on how users search for food. Made search 4 times faster by improving data fetching and sorting → key Series A metric.</li>
<li>Increased AUM for MealMe by working with CEO in development of MealCoin → decentralized currency for exchange on the app, which aims to move the company towards increasing profit margins and improving retention. Contributed to lowering cost of acqusition of users which led to rapid growth of ARR.</li>
<li>(Unified Product Search in development)</li>
